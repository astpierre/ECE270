# ECE270: Introduction to Digital System Design
### Purpose of this repo
The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a method to develop and test code outside of lab (aka, without the PLD board). As a TA for this course, I recognize how busy office hours can get, especially around the end of the course. If you are using this repo and find a bug, please feel free to contribute. Hope this helps!
### Steps to set up your environment
  1. obtain a free student copy of ModelSim PE from Mentor Graphics
  2. clone this repo and change your directory in ModelSim to point to that folder
  3. to run the example and see how you can use this as a template, enter the following command in your Transcript
    ``` ModelSim> do sim.do ```
#### you see the effects of your code by observing waveforms (ex shown below)
