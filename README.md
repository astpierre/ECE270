## ECE270: Introduction to Digital System Design [UNDER DEV DURING SUMMER 18]
  Course Description: An introduction to digital system design and hardware engineering, with an emphasis on practical design techniques and circuit implementation. Topics include number systems, Boolean algebra, theory of logic functions, mapping techniques and function minimization, logic equivalent circuits and symbol transformations, CMOS and TTL logic gate implementations, gate electrical and timing characteristics, critical path assessment and propagation delay measurement, analysis and synthesis of combinational circuits, programmable logic devices, hardware description languages, signed number notations and arithmetic, binary arithmetic logic circuits, theory of sequential circuits, state transition and timing diagrams, analysis and synthesis of sequential circuits, Mealy and Moore models of sequential circuits, register design, clock generation circuits, metastability and reliability considerations, and design of a simple computer.
  
  NOTE: The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the ability to develop and test rtl code outside of lab without the PLD. As a TA for this course, I recognize how busy office hours can get, especially around the lab practical. If you are using this repo and find a bug, please feel free to contribute using this vsc.
