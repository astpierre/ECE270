# ECE270
NOTE: This repository includes a verilog file with some of the building block verilog modules that were utilized in the course. I have not included lab specific solutions.

Content:
  ece270lab.txt is a skeleton file for the CPLD used in course containing LEDs/Pushbuttons/DIP Switches
  
  tb_ece270lab.txt is a test bench for the CPLD used in course so that I could simulate the lab experiements without being "in-lab". 
    I  used https://www.edaplayground.com/ for the environment for portability.
  
  practical_notes.v is a NON-COMPILABLE verilog file containing source code utilized during the course. 
    It is meant to be used as a reference, not a solution.
