# ECE270: Introduction to Digital System Design
  Course Description: An introduction to digital system design and hardware engineering, with an emphasis on practical design techniques and circuit implementation. Topics include number systems, Boolean algebra, theory of logic functions, mapping techniques and function minimization, logic equivalent circuits and symbol transformations, CMOS and TTL logic gate implementations, gate electrical and timing characteristics, critical path assessment and propagation delay measurement, analysis and synthesis of combinational circuits, programmable logic devices, hardware description languages, signed number notations and arithmetic, binary arithmetic logic circuits, theory of sequential circuits, state transition and timing diagrams, analysis and synthesis of sequential circuits, Mealy and Moore models of sequential circuits, register design, clock generation circuits, metastability and reliability considerations, and design of a simple computer.
  
  NOTE: This repository includes a verilog file with some of the building block verilog modules that were utilized in the course. I have  not included lab specific solutions.

# Contents
  ece270lab.txt is a skeleton file for the CPLD used in course containing LEDs/Pushbuttons/DIP Switches
  
  tb_ece270lab.txt is a test bench for the CPLD used in course so that I could simulate the lab experiements without being "in-lab". 
    I  used https://www.edaplayground.com/ for the environment for portability.
  
  practical_notes.v is a NON-COMPILABLE verilog file containing source code utilized during the course. 
    It is meant to be used as a reference, not a solution.
