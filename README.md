# ECE270: Introduction to Digital System Design Lab Simulator
## About
Demonstrate a method to develop and test verilog designs outside of lab (aka, without the PLD board). As a TA for this course, I recognize how busy office hours can get, especially around the end of the course. If you are using this and find a bug or a way to improve this, please feel free to reach out and/or contribute. Hope this helps!
## Setting up your environment
  1. obtain a [free student copy](https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition) of ModelSim PE from Mentor Graphics
  2. clone this repository and change your directory in ModelSim to point to the ECE270 folder
  3. to run the example and see how you can use this as a template, enter the following command in your ModelSim Transcript  
    ``` ModelSim> do sim.do ```
### you see the effects of your code by observing waveforms (ex shown below)
